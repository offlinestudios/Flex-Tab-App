# FlexTab Image Strategy

**Objective:** Support a professional SaaS aesthetic, not a fitness influencer brand.

**Tone:** Neutral, controlled, enterprise fitness-tech.

**Constraints:**
- No exaggerated musculature
- No dramatic lighting
- No hype or spectacle
- No aggressive facial expressions
- No motivational poster energy
- No loud branding or visual noise

## Image Category 1: Controlled Environment Training

**Purpose:** Prove capability through clarity and focus.

**Emotional Tone:** Calm determination. Concentration without strain.

**Composition Rules:**
- Subject: Single athlete performing compound lift (squat, deadlift, bench press, or overhead press)
- Camera distance: Medium shot (waist to head, or full body with breathing room)
- Angle: Eye-level or slightly below (not dramatic low angle)
- Background: Clean gym environment, minimal equipment visible, neutral walls
- Lighting: Even, soft, natural or studio lighting (no harsh shadows, no rim lighting)
- Faces: Visible but neutral expression, focused (not grimacing or celebrating)
- Clothing: Simple athletic wear, solid colors, no loud branding

**Frequency:** 2-3 images on landing page (hero section, feature story section)

**Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 (portrait) for mobile optimization

**Example Context:**
- Hero section background (subtle, not competing with text)
- Feature story section (showing consistency over time)

## Image Category 2: UI Screenshots (Product Interface)

**Purpose:** Show the mechanism. Prove the tool works.

**Emotional Tone:** Clarity, precision, trust through data.

**Composition Rules:**
- Subject: Clean screenshots of FlexTab interface showing key features
- Camera distance: Full screen capture or focused detail shot
- Content: Real data (not lorem ipsum), realistic workout logs, progression charts
- Background: Interface background (already designed in app)
- Lighting: N/A (digital interface)
- Framing: 1px border (#E6E4E1), 12px border radius, subtle shadow
- Context: Show progression over time, clear data visualization, easy-to-read metrics

**Frequency:** 3-4 images on landing page (feature story, feature grid)

**Aspect Ratio:** Native app aspect ratio (mobile screenshots preferred)

**Example Context:**
- Feature story: Chart showing progressive overload over 8 weeks
- Feature grid: Individual feature screenshots (custom exercises, measurements, history)

---

## Image Category 3: Detail Shots (Equipment & Environment)

**Purpose:** Establish professionalism through restraint and texture.

**Emotional Tone:** Quiet confidence. Quality without flash.

**Composition Rules:**
- Subject: Close-up of gym equipment (barbell, dumbbell, weight plate, chalk, notebook)
- Camera distance: Close-up (detail visible, but not macro)
- Angle: Straight-on or slight overhead
- Background: Neutral surface (gym floor, wooden bench, concrete), out of focus
- Lighting: Soft, diffused, natural light (no harsh highlights)
- Faces: None (equipment only)
- Context: Suggests preparation, consistency, ritual

**Frequency:** 1-2 images on landing page (proof section, CTA block background)

**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square) or 4:5 (portrait)

**Example Context:**
- Proof section: Subtle background image (low opacity overlay)
- CTA block: Textured background (very subtle, not competing with text)
